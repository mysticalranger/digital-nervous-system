## Checklist for Replit AI

1. **Seamless UX**
   - Review and optimize all user flows for speed, clarity, and delight.

   - Eliminate any bugs, glitches, or confusing elements.

2. **Performance & Scalability**
   - Stress-test for high concurrent users.
   - Optimize backend and frontend for low latency, especially on slow networks.

7. **AI/Feature Self-Improvement**
   - Confirm that the AI can analyze user data and autonomously suggest or implement new addictive features.

## Instructions

- **Reason step-by-step** through each checklist item.  
- **Fix or optimize** any issues found.
